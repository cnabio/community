### Agenda

- Bundle formats as part of the core spec and relationship to registries and security (https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/blob/master/104-bundle-formats.md)
 
- Notary V2 scenarios and requirements (https://github.com/SteveLasker/notary)

- Walkthrough of security spec PRs: [#301](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/281), [#302](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/282), and [#303](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/280)

- Moving security implementations into `github.com/cnabio` and discuss next steps

### Notes

- Bundle formats
  - Radu: clarify in Slack
  - Matt: can we have a formal process where someone like myself can verify and vouch that CNAB-Sec is compliant with CNAB-Core?
  - We can keep the process light by nominating one person in a team to make sure their changes are interoperable with other teams

- PRs
  - Let's get 301-304 reviewed and merged as first _working draft_
  - Trishank will circle back to 300 later
  - Matt, Chris, and others will review in the next 1-2 weeks
  - Radu and Trishank should make as much progress as possible with 300 in the same time frame
  - People are not likely to read external specs, so let's try to explain as much as possible

- Notary v2
  - Radu will track their work to see how it will impact us in the future
  - CNAB-Sec 1.0 will target Notary v1
  - CNAB-Sec 2.0 might target Notary v2
  - Trishank: add uses cases to Notary v2 (note to self)

- Implementations
  - Can we vote to move signy (Go) and pysigny (Python) to cnabio?
  - Chris: we should merge them so that they are visible
  - Radu: Go version is more advanced than Python right now, and the README makes clearly we are still in WD
  - Action items: we should start testing whether signy works with duffle / cnab-go
  - Transfer knowledge of Datadog use cases to signy and also Notary v2
