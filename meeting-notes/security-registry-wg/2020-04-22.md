### Agenda

* Welcome new CNABBERS
* Discuss where `signy` should verify in-toto metadata
  * OS?
  * Container: user-specified or bundle-developer-specified? Why not bundle-developer-specified? Discuss infinite regress of in-toto metadata verification.
  * Discuss [`signy#73`](https://github.com/cnabio/signy/pull/73), a PR that provides both OS or container verification
  * Jacob: would like to see a declarative API/DSL for well-known inspections
  * Radu: would like to see better UX for signy to OS/container verify
  * Jacob & Radu: inspections, just like invocation images, do open up some security issues about resource consumption for invocation and verification images
* Discuss simple in-toto software supply chains aka root layouts
  * ABC example
  * Datadog example
  * Collect CNAB uses cases users would like to see
  * CNAB use case: two steps
  * Image use case: also two steps
  * Jacob & Radu would like to support out-of-the-box signing for both bundles and images
  * Trishank: need to fix `signy` to verify images referred to in bundles, will be off by default, but people like Jacob can turn it on
  * Radu: `signy` can check signatures on bundles copied to a different registry, even with a different GUN, unlike Notary-v1
* Please review:
    * [`cnab-spec#288`](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/288)
    * [`cnab-spec#364`](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/364)
